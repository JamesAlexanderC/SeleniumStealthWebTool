# SeleniumStealthWebTool

This is a personal python and java built project.

The eventual aim for this project is to provide a framework for automating concurrent browser sessions.

I aim to provide powerful tools for automation at a large scale, but to the ability to individually edit each browser dynamically.

I will be using Camoufox, built in proxy support, captcha bypassing and a few anti-bot functions to make this framework appear more human, even at larger scales.
