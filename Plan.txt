decompose client to generalise behaviour

client will now connect to server and wait for commands - client should not send anything to server over socket except initial connection and responses

need to rewrite server code properly - use threads to connect to multiple clients concurrently, use an API and a web UI

use seleniumgrid to scale individual clients on one machine
